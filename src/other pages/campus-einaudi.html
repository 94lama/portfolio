        <h2>Campus Einaudi's urban regeneration</h2>
        <p style="margin:2rem">
            The University Campus, designed by Norman Foster, is placed in an ex-industrial area in front of the river Dora Riparia. The particular shape of the building is subsequent to its lot and it’s particulary prominent thanks to the strong contrast between the usual Turin’s buildings and itself. Its main task was to create a classic American-style Campus (generally opened to the outside) inside Turin. In order to achieve that, some openings were placed in each side of the building, which were closed immediately after its opening for security reasons. The aim of this project was to redefine the relationship between the Campus and the surrounding spaces. One of the main tasks was to reduce the acoustic level in the area (due to the high traffic level) with a padding area between the river and the main street obtained with massive objects and with Lungo Dora’s conversion from street to bike path. Then were placed new services, other bycicle paths in the area, a silence room and a new study room with river view.
