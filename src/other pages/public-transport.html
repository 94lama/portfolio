        <h2>Milazzo's public transport system</h2>
        <p style="margin:2rem">
            The project, which is a component of a series of projects made at various scales in the town, consists in the old pubblic transportation’s improvement (which at the moment consists in 5 bus lines with few users and even less passages per day... Maybe because it was not updated according to new user’s needs?). It is important considering also the amount of turists which each summer came to the city (and make its population double) and their favourite places: the dock, the castle and the town’s beaches (which, as you can se in the image on left, are quite a lot!). The new service will be based on bus’ prenotation, which once reached the preset minimum amount of users, will start its ride. In this way it will be possible to decrease strongly the exopenses dued to empty busses and obtaining at the same time new datas about users’ routines in order to update the alread existing bus lines. All new lines will have the same terminal and a linear path in common. They will futhermore use most of the already existing bus stops and 12 new ones, in order to give to all users a compete service, updated to all the new people’s necessities. They will be paired with a “Project zero” for a new bike mobility, which will be linked in the future to the other cities’ ones (already planned by nearby towns).
